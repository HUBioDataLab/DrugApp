# DrugApp: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Machine Learning-based Prediction of Drug Approval
In this study/repository, we presented a programmatic tool called “DrugApp”, that utilize available clinical trial- and patent-related data together with physicochemical and molecular features of drugs candidate compounds within a random forest classifier to predict their potential of getting approval as drugs for certain indications. The major contributions of our study are summarized below:
* We proposed comprehensive datasets, which can be useful for further computational studies as benchmarks.
* We presented important features for drug approval prediction, which can be used by both commercial and non-commercial entities to increase the efficiency of drug development procedures.
* We showed the potential of our method for revealing drugs that were withdrawn from the market sometime after their approval, indicating that it may be possible to act upon those cases in the first place to potentially prevent critical losses regarding human health. 
The modeling methodology of this study is summarized below.
